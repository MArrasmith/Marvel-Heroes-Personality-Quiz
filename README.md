Marvel Personalty Quiz

Description
    The Marvel Personality Quiz is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to discover which Marvel superhero they are most like, based on a series of carefully crafted questions. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just curious about your inner superhero, this quiz is sure to provide you with an entertaining experience.

    Unleash your inner hero and find out if you have what it takes to join the ranks of the Avengers to become one of Earth's mightiest heroes. Explore the Marvel universe like never before and see which iconic character matches your personality traits and preferences.


Badges
    On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

Visuals
    Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Installation
    Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

Usage
